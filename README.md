# Solitaire
My homemade version of the desktop solitaire game, for coding practice
This is practice using the object-oriented style in Python. 
Cards and decks are visually represented by buttons using the Tkinter GUI.
The mechanics of the game should be identical to that of the standard desktop version except there is no dragging cards here.
Instead, the player clicks on a "card source" deck and clicks on another  "card destination" deck to complete the card transfer.
